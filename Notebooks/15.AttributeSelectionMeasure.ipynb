    "# 15. Attribute Selection Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees recursively split features with regard to their target label's purity. Attribute selection measures are designed to find the **optimal point** of the **most predictive feature** in order to split 1 dataset into 2. These 2 new datasets’ target variable will be more pure than the original dataset’s. Purity means how homogeneous a dataset is.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we measure the **purity** of the 2 new datasets?\n",
    "The two most popular algorithms for measuring purity and selecting the optimal decisions in a decision tree are **Information Entropy** and **Gini Index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss how these two methods measure purty using three examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have 4 red gumballs and 0 blue gumballs, that group of 4 is 100% pure.\n",
    "- If we have 2 red and 2 blue, that group is 100% impure.\n",
    "- If we have 3 red and 1 blue, that group is either 75% or 81% pure, if we use Gini or Entropy respectively.\n",
